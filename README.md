just open index.html. will minify later

## Experiment for js13k game contest. attempt all vanilla js/html/css
- No audio files
- No sprites (created a python script to generate array for images)

### make it small and zipped up nicely. (thanks ai)
- npm install terser --save-dev
- npm install esbuild --save-dev
- npm install archiver --save-dev

### run node build.js to: 
- combine js into a single bundle
- minify a bunch of stuff
- zip it all up 

### Settings.js
- play with file to increase difficulty / speed / maze weight

### If i wanted to do more: 
- increase more difficulty between levels. increase enemy speed, maze weight
- better audio

### Ask
- if you want any of the tools to generate sprites, I saved it somewhere.
